Traffic Light System
In a community, people need stop-signs and traffic lights to slow down drivers from going too fast. To reduce danger at the intersections, time for switching red light to green light and green light to red light should be regulated carefully. Traffic light system is similar to the example in pages 124-129 in the text book, but with some improvements. As depicted in below figure, in the junction where road A and road B intersect, there are sensors SA and SB, installed in each road to sense the traffic. Each sensor will be TRUE if traffic is present and FALSE if the road is empty. There are two traffic lights LA and LB to control the traffic. The lights may change every 3 seconds, depending on the sensors. If a sensor is TRUE, the lights will not change until it is set to FALSE. If a light is green and sensor is FALSE it will turn to yellow and then red. Both lights will be red for 3 seconds, then red light will turn yellow for 3 seconds, and then turn green.
